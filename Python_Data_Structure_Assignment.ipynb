    "\n",
    "# In python, strings support indexing and slicing. Every individual units of a string (character) has a specific index value in the string, which helps in accessing required set of characters out of a given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Strings are indexed starting from 0 to (length of the string - 1) in left to right direction and -vely indexed starting from -1 to -(length of the string) in right to left direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# String slicing is a technique used to extract a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The general syntax for string slicing is \"string[start:stop:step]\"; in which start index, stop index and step value are optional at cases as per requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In string slicing, the start index value is inclusive and the stop index value is exclusive in nature.\n",

    "# Use Cases for Tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a)Fixed Data Grouping:\n",
    "# Tuples are useful when you want to store a group of related data that shouldn't change, like coordinates (x, y), RGB values (r, g, b), or dates (year, month, day).\n",
    "\n",
    "# b)Heterogeneous Data:\n",
    "# Since tuples can contain different data types, they are ideal for grouping heterogeneous data, like a record that might contain an integer, a string, and a boolean: (25, \"Alice\", True).\n",
    "\n",
    "# c)Dictionary Keys:\n",
    "# Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable (since they are immutable).\n",
    "\n",
    "# d)Iteration and Performance Optimization:\n",

    "# Efficient Data Comparison:\n",
    "# Sets allow easy and fast comparison of large datasets. For example, you can quickly check the common or different elements between two large collections using set operations.\n",

    "# Remove Elements by Value:\n",
    "# Since sets don’t allow duplicates, they are handy for operations where the removal of a specific value is required. You can use methods like discard() and remove() to handle elements.\n",
